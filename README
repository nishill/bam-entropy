Special Notes:

The bamtools c++ library is necessary to run and use code. 

The BamAlignmentIterator files were added to iterate through
the the alignments base by base. This program computes
the entropy of a given bam file based on information theory.

The CompressionIterator files are used as a new approach to 
analyze entropy. This time a tree structure is created as a 
list(genome position) of a map(base, QualInfo) of another
map ( QualScore, number of occureneces). This should allow for
the analysis of entropy on genetic variants.
