<!-- This is the template document for GNU web pages.  We use
     server side includes (#include) for common elements, for
     instance, the very first line of the file.  If you're reading
     this in its expanded form, you can retrieve the original source,
     with the SSI statements intact, from
     http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/boilerplate.html?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain
-->

<!-- Instructions for adapting this boilerplate to a new project: -->

<!-- 1. In the line above starting "Parent-Version:", remove the
        "$Revision...$" from around the revision number,
        leaving just Parent-Version: and the number. -->

<!-- 2. Replace "baz" with the name of your project.
        You should be able to do this with search and replace;
        making sure that the search is case insensitive and
        that the case of the replacement matches the case
        of the string found. In Emacs, query-replace will do this
        when case-fold-search and case-replace are both non-nil
        and both search and replacement string are given in lower case. -->

<!-- 3. Of course update the actual information according to your project,
        such as mailing lists, project locations, and maintainer name.  -->

<!-- 4. You can use the patch-from-parent script to semi-automate
        merging future changes to the boilerplate with your file:
        http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/patch-from-parent?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain
        -->

<!-- If you would like to make sure your page validates with HTML5, that
     would be a good thing.  To do that, change the first line from
     to /server/html5-header.html before trying the validation.  Maybe
     someday we will be able to make /server/header be HTML5.  -->

<h2>GNU Make</h2>

<p>GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other
non-source files of a program from the program's source files. </p>

<p>Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file
called the <i>makefile</i>, which lists each of the non-source files
and how to compute it from other files.  When you write a program, you
should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make to
build and install the program.</p>

<h4>Capabilities of Make</h4>

<ul>

<li>Make enables the end user to build and install your package
without knowing the details of how that is done -- because these
details are recorded in the makefile that you supply. </li>

<li>Make figures out automatically which files it needs to update,
based on which source files have changed.  It also automatically
determines the proper order for updating files, in case one non-source
file depends on another non-source file.

<p>As a result, if you change a few source files and then run Make, it
does not need to recompile all of your program.  It updates only those
non-source files that depend directly or indirectly on the source
files that you changed. </p> </li>

<li>Make is not limited to any particular language.  For each
non-source file in the program, the makefile specifies the shell
commands to compute it.  These shell commands can run a compiler to
produce an object file, the linker to produce an executable,
<code>ar</code> to update a library, or TeX or Makeinfo to format
documentation. </li>

<li>Make is not limited to building a package.  You can also use Make
to control installing or deinstalling a package, generate tags tables for
it, or anything else you want to do often enough to make it worth
while writing down how to do it. </li>

</ul>

<h4>Make Rules and Targets</h4>

<p>A <i>rule</i> in the makefile tells Make how to execute a series of
commands in order to build a <i>target</i> file from source files.
It also specifies a list of <i>dependencies</i> of the target file.
This list should include all files (whether source files or other targets)
which are used as inputs to the commands in the rule. </p>

<p>Here is what a simple rule looks like: </p>

<pre>
target:   dependencies ...
          commands
          ...
</pre>

<p>When you run Make, you can specify particular targets to update;
otherwise, Make updates the first target listed in the makefile.  Of
course, any other target files needed as input for generating these
targets must be updated first. </p>

<p>Make uses the makefile to figure out which target files ought to be
brought up to date, and then determines which of them actually need to
be updated.  If a target file is newer than all of its dependencies,
then it is already up to date, and it does not need to be regenerated.
The other target files do need to be updated, but in the right order:
each target file must be regenerated before it is used in regenerating
other targets. </p>

<h4>Advantages of GNU Make</h4>

<p>GNU Make has many powerful features for use in makefiles, beyond what
other Make versions have.  It can also regenerate, use, and then delete
intermediate files which need not be saved. </p>

<p>GNU Make also has a few simple features that are very convenient.  For
example, the <code>-o <i>file</i></code> option which says ``pretend that
source file <i>file</i> has not changed, even though it has changed.''
This is extremely useful when you add a new macro to a header file.
Most versions of Make will assume they must therefore recompile all the
source files that use the header file; but GNU Make gives you a way to
avoid the recompilation, in the case where you know your change to the
header file does not require it. </p>

<p>However, the most important difference between GNU Make and most
versions of Make is that GNU Make is free software. </p>

<h4>Makefiles And Conventions</h4>

<p>We have developed conventions for how to write Makefiles, which all
GNU packages ought to follow.  It is a good idea to follow these
conventions in your program even if you don't intend it to be GNU
software, so that users will be able to build your package just
like many other packages, and will not need to learn anything special
before doing so. </p>

<p>These conventions are found in the chapter
<a href="/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html#Makefile-Conventions">``Makefile conventions'' (147 k
characters)</a> of the <a href="/prep/standards.html">GNU Coding
Standards (147 k characters)</a>. </p>

<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-gnu">info-gnu</a>
(<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/">archive</a>).</p>

<p>Security reports that should not be made immediately public can be
sent directly to the maintainer.  If there is no response to an urgent
issue, you can escalate to the general
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/security">security</a>
mailing list for advice.</p>

<h3 id="contribute">Getting involved</h3>

<p>Development of
Make,
and GNU in general, is a volunteer effort, and you can contribute.  For
information, please read <a href="/help/">How to help GNU</a>.  If you'd
like to get involved, it's a good idea to join the discussion mailing
list (see above).</p>
